# Conway's Game of Life

"The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input."[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Interactive Python environment to observe this fenomenon.

Modules: `Pygame, NumPy, Time`

## How to try it out

To begin, you'll need to clone the project and install the required modules with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, to run the game, navigate to the folder where the code is and run the following command

```
python main.py
```

And there you go!

## Controls
